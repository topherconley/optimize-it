The strategies and methods detailed in:  \r\n  + optimize-vis-massifquant.Rnw      (source code)\r\n  + optimize-vis-massifquant.pdf      (human readable version)\r\n\r\nshow how to precisely visualize the effects of parameter variations on the IT detection results. The **mouse_data** and **figs** directories correspond to this analysis.  \r\n\r\n### Score-Based Optimization\r\nA score-based optimization is possible with a corresponding ground truth annotation of veritable IT sets and a carefully constructed evaluation metric (e.g. f-score). The document\r\n  + reproducing-greedy-search-optimization-figures.pdf  \r\n  \r\ndetails the greedy-search approach as well as how to reproduce the analysis depicted in the Massifquant publication. The compressed folder **gate-reproducible.tgz** has all the relevant data and scripts to reproduce the entire analysis.   \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
